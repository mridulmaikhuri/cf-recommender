# 🎯 CF Assistant

A randomized and adaptive codeforces problem recommendation system that helps competitive programmers discover problems tailored to their skill level and interests.

## 🧠 Recommendation Algorithm Explained

### 1. 📊 Data Collection

For a given user `handle`, the system fetches:

- User rating
- Submission history
- Full problemset with tags

### 2. 📝 Submission Parsing

The submission history is processed to build the following statistics:

- `attempted_tags`: weighted attempts per tag
- `solved_tags`: weighted successful solves per tag
- `attempted_problems`: set of all attempted problems
- `solved_problems`: set of all solved problems

#### 2.1 Weighting Mechanism

Each submission is weighted based on problem difficulty relative to the user's rating:

```
w = exp((problem_rating - user_rating) / (user_rating - 300))
```

This helps the system learn more from difficult attempts than from trivial ones.

### 3. 📈 Tag Weakness Estimation

After parsing submissions, the system estimates how weak the user is in each tag.

#### 3.1 Bayesian Smoothing

For each tag, a smoothed success probability is computed:

```
success = (solved + k * p) / (attempted + k)
```

Where:
- `p = 0.5`
- `k = 20 / sqrt(total_attempts + 1)`

This prevents unstable scores for tags with very few attempts.

#### 3.2 Exploration Term

To avoid overfitting to only frequently attempted tags, an exploration bonus is added:

```
exploration = c * sqrt(log(total_attempts + 1) / (attempted + 1))
```

Where:
- `c = 0.1`

This gives a boost to tags that have been explored less.

#### 3.3 Final Weakness Score

The final weakness score for each tag is:

```
weakness = (1 - success) + exploration
```

- Higher value means the user is weaker in that tag
- The values are normalized to [0, 1]

#### 3.4 Cold Start Handling

If the user has no submission history, all tags are assigned a default weakness:

```
weakness[tag] = 0.5
```

This ensures new users still get balanced recommendations.

### 4. 🔍 Candidate Filtering

The system considers only unsolved problems in a rating band around the user's rating:

- From `rating - 200` to `rating + 200`
- Rounded to the nearest 100

This keeps recommendations relevant and useful.

### 5. 🎲 Problem Scoring

Each candidate problem is assigned a score based on several factors.

#### 5.1 Average Weakness

The average weakness of all tags in the problem:
- Encourages problems that train the user's weaker areas

#### 5.2 Maximum Weakness

The maximum weakness among the problem's tags:
- Helps surface problems that target a particularly weak topic

#### 5.3 Tag Diversity

Problems with more tags are slightly preferred because they often provide broader practice:

```
tag_score = log(sqrt(num_tags) + 1)
```

#### 5.4 Unseen Bonus

Problems that the user has never attempted get a small bonus:

```
unseen_bonus = 1 if problem_key not in attempted_problems else 0
```

#### 5.5 Rating Proximity

Problems closer to the user's rating get a higher score:

```
rating_bonus = exp(-(diff^2) / (2 * 300^2))
```

Where:
- `diff = problem_rating - user_rating`

If the problem is below the user's rating, the bonus is slightly reduced to prefer stronger practice.

#### 5.6 Final Scoring Formula

The final score is a weighted combination of all features:

```
score =
  0.5 * avg_weakness +
  0.2 * max_weakness +
  0.1 * tag_score +
  0.05 * unseen_bonus +
  0.15 * rating_bonus
```

### 6. 🏆 Candidate Selection

After scoring, the system selects the final recommendations in two stages.

#### 6.1 Pre-Selection

- All candidate problems are sorted by score
- The top 500 problems are kept for the next stage

#### 6.2 Diversity Penalty

To avoid recommending too many similar problems, the system applies a penalty based on tag overlap with already selected problems:

```
penalty = sum(log(1 + common_tags))
```

This discourages repeated recommendations from the same narrow topic area.

#### 6.3 Softmax Sampling

Instead of choosing only the top-scoring problem every time, the system samples problems probabilistically:

```
P(i) = exp(score_i / T) / sum(exp(score_j / T))
```

Where:
- `T = 0.1`

A low temperature makes the sampling more focused on high-score candidates.

### 7. 📤 Final Output

Each recommended problem includes:

- Contest ID
- Problem index
- Problem name
- Rating
- Tags
- Score
- Direct link to the problem

## 🎯 Design Goals

This algorithm is designed to achieve the following:

- **Personalization**: recommendations depend on the user's own history
- **Weakness targeting**: weak tags are prioritized
- **Difficulty alignment**: problems stay close to the user's rating
- **Exploration vs exploitation**: strong matches are chosen, but variety is preserved
- **Diversity**: repeated tag patterns are reduced
